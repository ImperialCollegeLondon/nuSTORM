# nuSTORM

## Directories:
 * Python classes and "library" code stored in "01-Code"
 * Test scripts stored in "02-Tests"

Rudimentary, but, goal is one test script per class/package file in 01-Code.

## Dependencies:
 * Code and test scripts assume Python 3.  
 * Test scripts assume code directory (01-Code) is in PYTHON path.  A bash script "startup.bash" is provided to update the PYTHON path.
